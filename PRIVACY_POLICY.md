# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 2025

## Introduction

Chinese Reader ("we", "our", or "the app") is a free, open-source iOS application designed to help users learn Chinese through text recognition and dictionary lookup. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Chinese Reader is designed with privacy in mind. **All data processing happens entirely on your device.** We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal information on external servers.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Photos and Images

- **What we access:** When you use the camera or photo library features, the app accesses images you select or capture.
- **How we use it:** Images are processed locally on your device using Apple's Vision framework to extract Chinese text through OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
- **Storage:** **We do not store your photos or images.** Only the extracted text is saved to your device's local storage if you choose to save it.
- **Transmission:** Images are never transmitted to external servers or third parties.

### Captured Text

- **What we store:** If you choose to save captured text, it is stored locally on your device using SwiftData.
- **Storage location:** All saved texts, books, and collections are stored in your device's local database.
- **Access:** Only you have access to this data. It is not synced to the cloud or accessible by us or any third parties.
- **Deletion:** You can delete any saved text or book at any time through the app interface.

### Dictionary Data

- **Source:** The app uses the CC-CEDICT dictionary, which is a local file included with the app.
- **Usage:** Dictionary lookups are performed entirely on your device.
- **No network requests:** Dictionary queries do not require internet connectivity or transmit any data.

## Permissions

Chinese Reader requests the following permissions:

- **Camera Access:** Required to capture photos of Chinese text for OCR processing.
- **Photo Library Access:** Required to select existing photos from your library for OCR processing.

These permissions are used solely for the stated purposes and are not used to access any other data on your device.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to anyone.** All data remains on your device.

## Third-Party Services

Chinese Reader does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app operates entirely offline and does not require internet connectivity for core functionality.

## Children's Privacy

Chinese Reader does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since we do not collect any personal information, the app is safe for users of all ages.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:

- **Access:** All your data is accessible through the app interface.
- **Deletion:** You can delete any saved text, book, or collection at any time.
- **Complete removal:** Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data.

## Open Source

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
